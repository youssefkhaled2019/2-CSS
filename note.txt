CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

    Simple selectors :(select elements based on name, id, class)
    Combinator selectors: (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    Pseudo-class selectors :(select elements based on a certain state)
    Pseudo-elements selectors: (select and style a part of an element)
    Attribute selectors :(select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)



    Simple selectors  :name, id, class
    * {}
     -p {}
     -#para1 {}
     -.center {}
     h1, h2, p {}      Grouping Selector
