Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

    External CSS
    Internal CSS
    Inline CSS

==============================
In CSS there are five generic font families:

    [Serif] fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
    [Sans-serif] fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
    [Monospace ]fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
    [Cursive] fonts imitate human handwriting.
    [Fantasy] fonts are decorative/playful fonts.



The following list are the best web safe fonts for HTML and CSS:

    Arial (sans-serif)
    Verdana (sans-serif)
    Tahoma (sans-serif)
    Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)
    Times New Roman (serif)
    Georgia (serif)
    Garamond (serif)
    Courier New (monospace)
    Brush Script MT (cursive)

CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

    Simple selectors :(select elements based on name, id, class)
    Combinator selectors: (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    Pseudo-class selectors :(select elements based on a certain state)
    Pseudo-elements selectors: (select and style a part of an element)
    Attribute selectors :(select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)



    Simple selectors  :name, id, class
    * {}
     -p {}
     -#para1 {}
     -.center {}
     h1, h2, p {}      Grouping Selector
