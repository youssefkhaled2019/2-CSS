Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

    External CSS
    Internal CSS
    Inline CSS

==============================
In CSS there are five generic font families:

    [Serif] fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
    [Sans-serif] fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
    [Monospace ]fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
    [Cursive] fonts imitate human handwriting.
    [Fantasy] fonts are decorative/playful fonts.



The following list are the best web safe fonts for HTML and CSS:

    Arial (sans-serif)
    Verdana (sans-serif)
    Tahoma (sans-serif)
    Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)
    Times New Roman (serif)
    Georgia (serif)
    Garamond (serif)
    Courier New (monospace)
    Brush Script MT (cursive)

==============================
CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

    Simple selectors :(select elements based on name, id, class)
    Combinator selectors: (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    Pseudo-class selectors :(select elements based on a certain state)
    Pseudo-elements selectors: (select and style a part of an element)
    Attribute selectors :(select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)



    Simple selectors  :name, id, class
    * {}
     -p {}
     -#para1 {}
     -.center {}
     h1, h2, p {}      Grouping Selector


 ==============================    
 There are four different combinators in CSS:
    1-Descendant combinator (space)   ex: div p {}
    2-Child combinator (>)              ex: div > p {}
    3-Next sibling combinator (+)       ex: div + p {}
    4-Subsequent-sibling combinator (~)  ex: div ~ p {}
==============================

What are Pseudo-classes?   {:pseudo-class}

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

    Style an element when a user moves the mouse over it
    Style visited and unvisited links differently
    Style an element when it gets focus
    Style valid/invalid/required/optional form elements
==============================
What are Pseudo-Elements?

A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specific parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

    Style the first letter or line, of an element
    Insert content before or after an element
    Style the markers of list items
    Style the viewbox behind a dialog box
